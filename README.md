## **Inside the work**

# **Explanation of the ARIMA Forecasting Plot**

This chart displays the forecasting of **'XLarge Bags'** using the **ARIMA model**, ensuring that the minimum order is **5 Bags**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Train Data (Blue Line)**
- Represents the **historical data** used to train the ARIMA model.
- Significant spikes in the quantity of **'XLarge Bags'** indicate **fluctuating demand** over time.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Actual Test Data (Green Line)**
- The test dataset contains the **real values** for **'XLarge Bags'** that were not used during training.
- However, the test data is **either very small or missing**, which could mean:
  - There were **very few or zero** **'XLarge Bags'** in recent data.
  - The dataset might have a **large gap between training and test samples**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ ARIMA Forecast (Red Line)**
- The **ARIMA model** predicts **future values** based on past patterns.
- The forecasted values remain **flat and close to 5**, meaning the model predicts **very low future demand**.
- Since we enforced a **minimum order of 5 Bags**, the forecast **does not drop below this threshold**.

## **üîç Possible Issues**
- The **sudden drop** in values after training suggests that **'XLarge Bags'** might have **insufficient data** in the later periods.
- The model might be **overfitting** to earlier fluctuations but **fails to detect strong trends for the future**.

# **Explanation of the Visualization**  

## **1. What This Chart Represents**  
- The graph compares the **XLarge Bags sales** (üî¥ **red line**) with **Total Volume sales** (üîµ **blue line**) over time.  
- Both values are **normalized** (scaled between 0 and 1) for better comparison.  
- A **moving average smoothing technique** is applied to reduce noise and highlight trends.  

## **2. Key Observations**  
- The **spikes** in **XLarge Bags** (**red line**) indicate **occasional large demand** but **overall lower volume** compared to total sales.  
- The **Total Volume** (**blue line**) follows a **similar trend** but with **larger fluctuations**, meaning other bag sizes contribute **more** to the total volume.  
- There are periods where **XLarge Bags have little to no sales**, suggesting they are **not consistently in demand**.  

## **3. What This Means for Decision-Making**  
- **If the goal is to phase out XLarge Bags**, the **low demand** suggests it would have **minimal impact** on overall sales.  
- **If keeping them but enforcing a minimum order of 5 bags**, it may **not significantly affect sales** since demand is already **inconsistent**.  
- The **strong correlation at certain points** suggests that **XLarge Bags contribute at peak times** but are **not a primary driver of sales**.
